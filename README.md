 - I am an Android Developer at TCS, currently expanding my knowledge in AWS and honing my skills in UI/UX design. I graduated in computer science from [Cooch Behar Government Engineering College](http://cgec.org.in/index.php) in 2021. During my college years, I developed a strong passion for Java, which led me to start learning and creating Android apps, following the MVVM architecture and utilizing Android Jetpack. Prior to joining TCS, I completed two internships.

 - From a very early age, I've had a deep love for technology, and this affection has helped me cultivate a strong technological mindset and a thirst for learning. I firmly believe that there is no limit to the knowledge one can acquire 🧠.

 - I hold a strong belief in the importance of continuous learning throughout our journey. I believe that if one ever stops this process, they are no longer in the game.

 - I see social media as a powerful tool for crafting and controlling one's digital identity. I am a testament to the impact of digital identity and strongly advocate for establishing a meaningful online presence.
